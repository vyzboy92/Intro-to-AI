Planning, coordination, communication, and regulation are the most fundamental pieces of any successful team.
AI Team comprises of individuals possessing unique skillsets and fast-paced work methodology which enables them to take any product or solution from ideation to realization in the shortest time possible.
We do this by incorporating knowledge of multiple software stacks and our research-based methodology for problem-solving.
The Skroll outlines and dictates our team’s vision, policies, guidelines, roles, research methodologies, project management, knowledge sharing, community guidelines, training syllabus, etc.

The team hierarchy although flat in practice, adds some layer of management where all members report directly to the  CTO, **Charush S Nair**. The Team Lead, **Vysakh S Mohan**, coordinates the overall functioning of the team. Detailed roles of every member of the team can be viewed in the roles section.

This open guide book will serve as a template to outline the culture of the team and helps new joiners to quickly get on board with us. Existing members can always revisit the guide to freshen up their memory and to add to their profiles, the cutting edge new “thing” they are working on.

## Quick Guide
Our culture is key to the functioning of the team. The agendas of the team are set on the basis of project requiremnts, business insights and team OKR.
Following are the contents of this repo, which discuss some of the core elements at its fullest.

### RoI+

RoI+ stands for Return of Information Positive. Its Accubits' initiative to return knowledge to the community from where we consume.
Most of the learning and upskilling involves every one accessing information and knowledge from online and offline sources. ROI+ makes sure we too contribute to the same community with what we have learned from them along with what we understood from our experience. Since we are huge promoters of opensource, we contribute to the community by sharing our learnings, opensource projects, discussions, blogs, article and research projects.

* [Blogs](https://github.com/accubits-tech/Skroll/blob/master/ROI%2B/blogs.md)
* [Opensource Contribution](https://github.com/accubits-tech/Skroll/blob/master/ROI%2B/opensource.md)
* [Research](https://github.com/accubits-tech/Skroll/blob/master/ROI%2B/research.md)
